Muuvboard
(/mo͞ovbôrd/)

A personal moodboard app written in Django, React, and Konva. Consider it a mixture of Pinterest, a Booru, and PureRef. No where near a presentable state, but being worked on at the moment.

Objective
Use libraries first, than refactor out as needed.
If something is too hard, quite literally just skip it
Honestly just write god awful code and fix it later, but make sure to test it.

Todos:
Refactor out Image Pin from Pins
Thumbnails for Images
Boards show last updated as last updated pin
Refactor Boards into viewset
Cartesian Graph - Before 1.0.0
